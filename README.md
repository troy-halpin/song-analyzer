# Song Analyzer

Currently, `index.ts` is a script that hits [Sonic API's analyze/key endpoint](http://www.sonicapi.com/docs/api/analyze-key) submitting a public url to "Mary Had A Little Lamb"

## How to execute

With Deno installed, run `deno --allow-net index.ts` from root

## TODO

- More analysis
- Allow user-chosen files
- A frontend
